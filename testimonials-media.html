                    <p class="quote">"It was my great pleasure to bring Stephen Jepson to our Danish School of Design in Kolding, Denmark, for the Yearly Design Camp 2013. The theme for the 2-week long camp was 'Play to Design.' Stephen gave two presentations for the international students... Stephen's presentation was a blast!! With his wonderful, passionate, and personal authority Stephen won every person in the room over and received standing ovations from the crowd! They got it and I am sure it was a life-changing speech for many of them. And a start for change . . . I highly recommend Stephen Jepson as a speaker and a motivator.

                        <li><strong>Shabnam (Rated 5.0 out of 5):</strong><br>"Amazing idea! I am amazed by your idea and using your techniques I'm trying to train my mother who has movement and balance issue due to a brain stroke and trying to help her build new neuropaths and she is very hopeful after watching these videos."</li>
                        <li><strong>Ken Rohla (Rated 5.0 out of 5):</strong><br>"Stephen Lives What He Teaches. I've known Stephen for about 19 years and he has always lived what he teaches about never leaving the playground. He has taken me on many trips kayaking in boats of his own design and manufacture, skateboarding, biking, and hiking, rope walking, and making pottery, which he is a master at. He is young of heart!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Bob Hoye (Rated 3.0 out of 5):</strong><br>"Just spent a week at JCCFS taking pottery classes from Stephen. I got a mix of his fantastic pottery skills with some valuable observations on life. Looking forward to the next time!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Joan Vernikos, Author of "Designed To Move" (Rated 5.0 out of 5):</strong><br>"Designed to Move is the title of my new book following up on Sitting Kills Moving Heals. Thank you Stephen for being such a fan. It's mutual of course. Designed to move gets into the mechanics of optimal motion. We are designed to be perpetual motion machines – cannot think of anyone other than you who would be more qualified."</li>
                        <li><strong>"Fascinating!" (Rated 5.0 out of 5):</strong><br>"I stumbled across Stephen a year or two ago and found both his outlook and creativity fascinating. There is a lot of thinking outside the box (you'd probably find Stephen leapfrogging the box!) and innovation, I found myself relating to it and proceeded to draw inspiration and ideas, I still regularly practice balancing and other things I have learned."</li>
